The file manager project is a C-based implementation of a linked list designed to manage a collection of files. It includes fundamental features such as creating a new file node, inserting a file into the linked list, deleting a file from the linked list, and displaying all files in the list. The file nodes store information such as the file name, size, creation date, and modification date. This simple file manager allows users to manage a custom collection of files and perform basic operations while offering the flexibility to extend its functionality with additional features, such as searching for files, sorting files by different criteria, and managing files on the disk.
